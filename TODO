Ugh, a lot.

1. k3a's todos for functionality (I need a link)
2. not using xibs
4. no SiriObjects.h at each directory.
5. Fix templates for #4
6. install extensions individually.
7. fix bug with sending messages through siri (it sends, but assistantd gets to eternal lag for some reason)
8. someday place AEX into a separate submodule so it can accept (a lot of) improvements
